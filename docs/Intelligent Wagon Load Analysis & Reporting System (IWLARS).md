### **Project Overview: Intelligent Wagon Load Analysis & Reporting System (IWLARS)**

The primary goal is to develop an end-to-end system that captures sensor data from a moving train, processes it in the cloud, performs detailed analysis on each wagon's load, and automatically generates a comprehensive PDF report.

### **Recommended Approach: A Modular, Agile Framework**

I recommend an **Agile development methodology**, organized into two-week sprints. This approach will provide flexibility, allow for continuous testing and feedback, and ensure the project stays on track. The architecture should be **highly modular**, separating the system into four key microservices or components:

1. **Acquisition Module:** Runs on the edge computer (e.g., Jetson) to capture and buffer sensor data.  
2. **Processing Service:** A cloud-based service that handles point cloud cleaning, wagon segmentation, and alignment.  
3. **Analytics Service:** A cloud-based service that takes processed data and calculates all key metrics (volume, weight, balance, status).  
4. **Reporting Service:** A cloud service that generates the final PDF report and handles its distribution/storage.

This modularity allows different parts of the system to be developed and scaled independently.

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Acquisition (Weeks 1-2)**

This phase focuses on establishing the project's infrastructure and building the data collection module that interfaces with the hardware.

* **Sprint 1 Goal:** Successfully capture, time-sync, and upload raw LiDAR and IMU data to a cloud storage bucket.  
* **Key Milestones & Tasks:**  
  * **Architecture & Setup (Week 1):**  
    * **Finalize Tech Stack:** Confirm the use of Python for the backend, Open3D/NumPy for data processing, FastAPI for the API, WeasyPrint (HTML to PDF) for reporting, and AWS/Firebase for the cloud.  
    * **Cloud Infrastructure:** Set up an AWS S3 bucket for raw data storage and a basic IAM role for secure access.  
    * **Development Environments:** Configure local and shared development environments.  
  * **Data Acquisition (Week 2):**  
    * **Sensor Interfacing:** Develop Python scripts to connect and read data streams from the LiDAR (via Ethernet) and IMU sensors.  
    * **Time-Synchronization:** Implement logic to ensure LiDAR and IMU data points have synchronized timestamps.  
    * **Local Buffering:** Create a buffer on the flight computer to prevent data loss during temporary network outages.  
    * **Secure Cloud Upload:** Build the function to securely upload the raw, time-synced data files to the S3 bucket.

### **Phase 2: Core Processing & Initial Analytics (Weeks 3-5)**

With data flowing into the cloud, this phase focuses on making sense of it: identifying wagons and calculating their most important physical properties.

* **Sprint 2 & 3 Goals:** Process raw point cloud data to segment individual wagons and calculate their volume and estimated weight.  
* **Key Milestones & Tasks:**  
  * **Data Preprocessing (Week 3):**  
    * **Data Cleaning:** Develop algorithms to filter noise and artifacts from the raw LiDAR point clouds.  
    * **Sensor Fusion:** Use IMU data to correct the LiDAR point cloud, transforming it into a stable, world-aligned frame of reference.  
    * **Ground Plane Removal:** Implement a function to identify and remove the ground plane from the point cloud, isolating the train wagons.  
  * **Wagon Segmentation (Week 4):**  
    * **Detection Algorithm:** Implement a robust algorithm (e.g., using gap detection or point cloud clustering) to segment the continuous data stream into individual point clouds, one for each wagon.  
    * **Data Structuring:** Store these segmented wagon point clouds as separate, labeled files or objects.  
  * **Volume & Weight Algorithms (Week 5):**  
    * **Volume Estimation:** For each wagon's point cloud, use a 3D surface reconstruction method (e.g., Convex Hull or Alpha Shapes) to calculate the material volume.  
    * **Weight Estimation:** Implement the logic to convert the calculated volume into an estimated weight based on a configurable material density.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Analysis & Report Generation (Weeks 6-8)**

This phase completes the analysis, develops the final user-facing deliverable (the PDF report), and integrates the full pipeline.

* **Sprint 4 & 5 Goals:** Calculate advanced metrics, automatically generate a pixel-perfect PDF report matching the example, and finalize the cloud API.  
* **Key Milestones & Tasks:**  
  * **Advanced Analytics (Week 6):**  
    * **Balance Calculation:** Develop the algorithm to analyze the symmetry of the material within each wagon's point cloud to determine left-right and top-bottom balance deviations.  
    * **Status Classification:** Define and implement the rules to classify each wagon as Normal, Empty, Overloaded, or Unbalanced based on the calculated metrics.  
  * **PDF Report Generation (Week 7):**  
    * **HTML Template:** Create an HTML/CSS template that precisely matches the layout, tables, and charts of the example PDF (Comprehensive\_Train\_Analysis\_TR-8901.pdf).  
    * **Data-to-Chart:** Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js or D3.js, rendered server-side) to generate the five required charts (Pie, Bar, Line, Scatter, Histogram).  
    * **PDF Conversion:** Use WeasyPrint to convert the data-populated HTML template into the final PDF.  
    * **QR Code Generation:** Integrate a library to generate the QR code linking to the cloud report.  
  * **API & Integration (Week 8):**  
    * **Develop API Endpoint:** Create a main API endpoint (e.g., /generate-report) that triggers the entire data processing and analysis pipeline.  
    * **End-to-End Testing:** Run a full integration test with a sample dataset, ensuring the flow from raw data upload to final PDF generation works seamlessly.

### **Phase 4: Testing, Deployment & Handover (Weeks 9-10)**

The final phase is focused on hardening the system, addressing edge cases, and preparing for production deployment.

* **Sprint 6 Goal:** Deploy a stable, documented, and thoroughly tested system.  
* **Key Milestones & Tasks:**  
  * **Refinement & Edge Cases (Week 9):**  
    * **Stress Testing:** Test the system with large datasets to ensure performance and scalability.  
    * **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for scenarios like incomplete scans, sensor disconnects, or unexpected data.  
    * **Bug Fixing:** Address any issues identified during integration testing.  
  * **Deployment & Documentation (Week 10):**  
    * **Deployment Scripts:** Prepare deployment scripts (e.g., using Docker or serverless configurations) for easy and repeatable deployment.  
    * **Code Documentation:** Ensure the entire codebase is well-commented and documented.  
    * **Final Handover:** Deliver the complete source code, deployment scripts, testing logs, and documentation.  
    * **(Optional) Dashboard Development:** If time permits, begin work on the simple web dashboard for viewing report history.

## Simulating Real-Time Wagon Data and Processing

To test the IWLARS pipeline as if data is arriving from a moving train in real time, follow this simulation approach:

1. **Prepare Sample Data:**
   - Place sequential LiDAR (.pcd) and IMU (.csv) files in `data/raw/frames/`. Each file represents a new sensor frame.

2. **Timed Data Loader:**
   - Implement a loader in `src/sensors/data_loader.py` that watches the directory and, at fixed intervals (e.g., every 1 second), loads the next file and passes it to the processing pipeline.

3. **Pipeline Trigger:**
   - The loader calls the processing functions (ground filtering, segmentation, analytics, etc.) for each frame, simulating real-time data flow.

4. **Automated Reporting:**
   - After all frames are processed, the pipeline can generate reports as in production.

5. **Optional API Trigger:**
   - You can expose a FastAPI endpoint to start the simulation from a dashboard or script.
